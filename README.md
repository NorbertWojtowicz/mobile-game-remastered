# mobile-game-remastered

2d pixel-art mobile game made in cocos2d-x engine. This is one of my first bigger projects, made at the turn of 2020 and 2021.
Game lore and characters are based on League of Legends.
In the near future, the code will be cleaned and new functionalities will be added.

The playable version should be released for download in some time.

Short presentation of game is available at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Rdb3V7Lr9Q
